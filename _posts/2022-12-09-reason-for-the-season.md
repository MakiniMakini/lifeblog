I know, I know, from the title, you’d assume this is most likely about the holiday season we are in at this time of the year. Well, sorry, but this is a different tale. I’d like to introduce you to my plant, Camilla (I just gave it a random name, nothing too complicated).

Camilla was gifted to me by someone close to me and it was exciting because I had wanted to own a plant for the longest time. Camilla was everything a house plant was meant to be. It was dark green with white spots here and there, and a beautiful flower sprouting at its centre. It made the little corner where it lived beautiful and worth looking at every so often as it complimented the space perfectly. I mean, even you would love her! (I wish I knew her exact species though). To take care of it, I watered it and exposed it to sunlight once in a few days.

A few months later, I had to be away from my room for a number of weeks. I decided to leave Camilla by the window so that it could get unlimited sunlight while I was away. Well, that was not the best idea because when I returned, it was all dried up because of exposure to too much heat with no water. I was devastated; I couldn’t imagine having killed Camilla because of my poor decision. I decided to do some quick ‘first aid’ by watering it and changing its location and to my surprise, it actually worked. Within a few days, Camilla was all green again and had new shoots sprouting. Oh the joy! I was actually not a bad plant owner after all, huh? Camilla continued to flourish and that brought me so much joy.

However, one day, I randomly looked at Camilla, and there it stood, its new shoots fallen and flimsy. I was so shocked. My first thought was that someone or even I had accidentally hit it when leaving because it was near the door. I tried putting it out in the sun, but to no avail. It seemed to be getting worse as the parent leaves started getting affected as well. It also became loosely anchored into the soil; you could yank it out with a slight pulling force. It was very heart-breaking. I know that love and loss go hand in hand and that nothing in this earth lives forever, but it was hard to comprehend that at that moment. I have seen Camilla in all its seasons, from when it flourished the most, when it was going through a difficult moment and now when it lay helplessly dead.

 I relate my experience with Camilla to our everyday experiences. We go through seasons in life, seasons of joy, of grief, of success, of failure of tears, of laughter, and so on. At an individual level, God takes us through each season for a reason, the ultimate reason being for the glory of His name. No season we encounter is in vain, and I hope we get to fully embrace that.
